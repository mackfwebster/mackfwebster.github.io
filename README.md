Many changes you can yourself do right here on the GitHub.

For any text content, change the files in the `data` folders.

E.g., navigate to `research1.yml`, click the edit (pencil) button, make changes, and then 'commit changes.' The website will rebuild itself with those changes.

If you're adding any images (or other files), do that in the `static/images` folder.

There are many many other things you can do with this theme (e.g., see the various widgets on the [demo site](https://caressofsteel.github.io/demos/hugo/hugo-story/)) but that might be a bit more involved.

If you wanna do that, just let me know!
